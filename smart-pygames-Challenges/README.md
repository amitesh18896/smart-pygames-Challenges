The logic of this game is very simple. Once it is run, there is a window where it explains the rules of how to play the game. Rules: there are two players, and a pack of beers. Each user takes turns to drink beers from the pack, and should drink only 1 to 3 beers each time. The player who drinks the last beer in the pack loses the game, and has to buy a new pack of beers. The other player is a winner, and gets to drink for free. On this window, there is a button that says “Play Now”, which starts the game.

Once the game is started, there will be 14 beers on the top to select from, and “Drink” button to drink the selected beers, and two places which shows the number of beers each player drinks. Players click on the beers to determine how many they want to drink each time, and presses the “Drink” button to drink them. Once the button is clicked, the selected beers disappear, and the number is written down on the players’ score accordingly. They keep doing this until the last one is drunk. When the last one is drunk, it brings up a new window where it shows the winner and the loser. On this page, there is also a “Play Again” button, where players can start over without quitting and restarting the game.
